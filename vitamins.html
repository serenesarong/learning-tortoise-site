    				<h2>Vitamins, Calcium and Supplements</h2>

    				<p>Vitamins and calcium are very important to keep your tortoise healthy and happy.  Calcium is a must for healthy bone and shell growth, and Vitamin D supplements are advisable so that your tortoise can absorb and metabolise the calcium in its diet.  There are many different supplements on the market</p>

    				<h3>Vitamin Supplements</h3>

    				<p>Vitamin supplements usually come in powder form that can be sprinkled on food a couple of times a week.  Most vitamin supplements specifically for reptiles have Vitamin D and calcium in them, as all reptiles need a good supply of both of these to be healthy.  It is worth doing some research, and speaking to tortoise breeders/keepers on forums to find out what they recommend.</p>

    				<p>I personally use Nutrobal calcium and vitamin supplement, but there are many others on the market.</p>

    				<h3>Calcium</h3>

    				<p>Calcium can also be found in many forms, including:</p>
    					<ul>
    						<li>Cuttlefish Bones (whole and crushed)</li>
    						<li>Limestone flour</li>
    						<li>Natural Chalk lumps and granules</li>
    						<li>Branded calcium powder (usually with added Vitamin D3)</li>
    						<li>Calcium liquids (for adding to water)</li>
    					</ul>

    				<p>I always provide a cuttlefish bone for each tortoise in their enclosures so that they can chew it as and when they feel like it, and occasionally sprinkle limestone flour on their food (although the Nutrobal supplement is also a calcium supplement, I feel it provides a bit of variety for them).</p>

    				<p>I have never used liquid calcium for tortoises as it is difficult to know how much water they have taken in, and so can be hard to estimate if they are taking enough calcium through drinking.  I find that powder sprinkled on food is a better way to see how much calcium the tortoise is getting as you can see the powder, and watch your tortoise eating.</p>

    				<p>Cuttlefish bones and chalk lumps are good sources of calcium, and are also useful for keeping your tortoise's beak in trim, as while they are biting at them it wears down the pointed tip of the beak and prevents it from getting overgrown.</p>

    				<h3>Water Conditioners</h3>

    				<p>If you are giving your tortoise water from a tap rather than rain water from a water butt, it is a good idea to add a water conditioner to it, which will remove any added chemicals such as chlorine.  While these chemicals act as a bacteriacide, making the water fit for human consumption, too high a dose for your tortoises and other reptiles can cause health problems.  There are a great many brands of water conditioner on the market, most in liquid form.  Usually a few drops added to your tortoises water bowl is enough, but please read the instructions on the bottle to make sure!</p>
