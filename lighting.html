    				<h2>Lighting</h2>

					<h3>The importance of UV light.</h3>

					<p>UV lighting is important for all reptiles kept in captivity.  It helps to promote a natural feeding response and, more importantly helps the animal to produce vitamin D which aids the absorbtion of calcium to build healthy bones.  Reptiles, including tortoises, that don't get enough UV light can suffer vitamin D and Calcium deficiency which can lead to skeletal problems and Metabolic Bone Disorder (MBD) which is similar to Ricketts in humans.</p>

					<p>A good quality UV bulb that provides both UVA and UVB light is essential for the health of your tortoise.</p>

					<h3>Types of UV lighting</h3>

					<p>As with heat bulbs there are a huge range of options when considering which lamp to get for your tortoise, and it is really down to personal preference and what kind of set up you have as to which is most suitable.</p>

					<p>Most reptile shops will stock a good range of basking bulbs and UV bulbs, and online stores such as Amazon and Ebay are also good places to buy.  Most UV (and basking) bulbs come with an Edison Screw fitting so it is recommended that you make sure you have a lamp holder with an ES screw fitting so that you can use the bulbs!  Most reptile specific bulb holders are made with ES screw fittings, and are generally rated for higher temperatures than standard light fittings (i.e. desk lamps if you can find one with an ES fitting!).  I would recommend getting reptile specific lamp holders for this reason.  Companies such as Komodo, ProRep, Exo Terra and others do a range of lamp holders all with ES fittings that are rated for the bulbs they sell.</p>

					<p>As well as bulbs, it is also possible to get UV tubes in a variety of sizes, which do provide a larger area of lighting for bigger enclosures, but can be a lot more expensive to buy both the tubes and the initial set up.  Most bulbs are self ballasting, and will therefore just screw in to any ES fitted lamp holder.  Most tubes need ballast and will need extra equipment to set up, although it is possible to find tube holders which have all the necessary electrics in one sealed unit.</p>

					<p>I personally use bulbs in my enclosures now.  I have used tubes in the past but after problems with the mounting for the tube, moved back to bulbs for ease of changing and cost efficiency.</p>

					<p>UV bulbs and tubes come in three different levels, 2.0, 5.0 and 10.0.  Manufacturers of the bulbs advise that 2.0 should be used for reptiles whose natural habitats are mainly shady, such as Jungle habitats where the UV levels are naturally low due to filtering through foliage, 5.0 for reptiles from more open habitats where there would be some shading, and 10.0 for reptiles from desert habitats where the UV levels are naturally very high.  It is essential to research the type of tortoise you want, and look at where it would live in the wild before getting a UV bulb or tube so that you can get the right UV level for your species of tortoise.  As with humans, too high levels of UV light can damage your tortoise's eyes, and too low levels of UV can cause other health issues.</p>

					<h3>Placement and Bulb replacement.</h3>

					<p>UV bulbs do not give off much heat as most of the energy is given off in light (unless you have a basking bulb with UV light).  This means you can place the bulb anywhere above the enclosure without it causing too many problems with temperature control.  I do tend to put mine close to the basking spot so that when the tortoises are basking, they are also getting a good dose of UV light as well.</p>

					<p>It is a good idea to place your UV bulb as low as possible (as long as it is out of reach of the tortoise) so that the tortoise can absorb as much UV as possible.  It is also a good idea to use a reflective dome so that all of the UV light is reflected down towards the tortoise, and is not wasted by escaping upwards and sideways from the bulb.</p>

					<p>UV bulbs and tubes will lose their effectiveness over time and their UV rating will decrease.  It is essential to change your UV bulb or tube at least every six months to maintain a high enough level of UV output.</p>
