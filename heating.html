    				<h2>Heating</h2>

					<h3>Why is heating important?</h3>

					<p>Reptiles such as snakes, geckos and other lizards take a lot of their heat from rocks and sand warmed by the sun.  Unlike these other types of reptile, tortoises take their heat through the upper part of their shell, directly from the sun in the wild, or from a heat bulb when kept in captivity.</p>
					<p>Like all reptiles tortoises cannot regulate their own body temperature like mammals can, and so they need a good temperature gradient across their enclosure so that they can move to a basking spot when cold and into a cooler area when warm to regulate the temperature of their blood and stay healthy</p>

					<h3>Types of heating</h3>

					<p>Because tortoises take in their heat from above, heating equipment such as heat mats or heated rocks are not suitable as they can cause burns and provide very little benefit to the tortoise.  For this reason it is best to use a heat lamp suspended above your tortoises enclosure.</p>
					<p>A good quality basking heat lamp is essential to keep your tortoise healthy, and to stimulate eating and the proper digestion of food.  If your tortoise becomes too cold, they will likely go off their food and start to become less active, beginning the process of hibernation</p>

					<h3>Placement</h3>

					<p>It is a good idea to place your basking bulb at one end of the tortoise's enclosure, with a probe to monitor the temperature of the basking area.  Adjustable bulb holders can be bought so that you can raise or lower the bulb to adjust the temperature in the enclosure.  You should also monitor the temperature of the cool end of the enclosure to make sure it doesn't get too hot or too cold</p>

					<h3>Types of bulbs</h3>

					<p>There are a huge number of bulbs on the market and it is really down to preference which type you use. I am a fan of white coloured reptile specific basking spot lamps, as they provide a good amount of heat and light, but other incandescent bulbs that provide heat can be used.</p>
					<p>Ceramic heat bulbs can also be used as a heat source, but as these do not provide any light, I don't feel they are as good.</p>
					<p>Red basking spotlights are readily available as well, but as tortoises are not nocturnal, these should not be used as the red light can cause eye problems.  If you are going to use a basking bulb, always use a white coloured one!</p>
					<p>It is also possible to get bulbs that incorporate both heat and UV in one bulb.  I prefer to use seperate bulbs, as I find the basking bulbs need replacing far more frequently than the UV bulbs, and it seems to work out cheaper to have seperate bulbs.</p>
