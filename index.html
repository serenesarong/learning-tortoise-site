    				<h2>Introduction</h2>

    				<h3>The wonders of Tortoises</h3>

					<p>Tortoises can make delightful pets, full of character and with their own individual personalities.  With the correct care and environment they will be companions for a very long time.</p>
					<p>With exotic pets becoming more and more popular, tortoises are once again fashionable pets to own, but it is important to remember that, cared for properly, these animals will live for many years, and may even out live their owners!</p>
					<p>Each species of tortoise has it's own requirements for heating, lighting, diet and other environmental factors, so it is a good idea to research thoroughly before deciding which type of tortoise to get, especially as some types will get quite large and will need a LOT of space!</p>
					<p>This site is not a 'how to' for every type of tortoise.  Though it has got some information, I am not an expert on tortoise keeping, and have made some mistakes along the way.  It is always best to do as much research as possible, from a wide variety of sources so that you can give your tortoise the best care possible.  I have included links to some useful sites that have helped me provide the best environment I can for my 'Tiny Tanks'.</p>

					<h3>My Tiny Tanks</h3>

					<div class="three-up-panel-item">

					<h4>Nessie</h4>

					<IMG SRC="images\Nessie.JPG" ALT="Photograph of Nessie"/>
						<span>Nessie is a 7 year old Horsfield (Testudo Horsfeldii), who has been in our little family for four years.  She is a grumpy lady at times and likes to get her own way, especially when stomping around in the garden with penn.  She can move faster than anyone would expect when she wants to (usually when my back is turned after I put her on the lawn) and she enjoys making a break for the undergrowth as soon as she is outside.</span>

						<h4>Ivor</h4>

						<IMG SRC="images\ivor.jpg" ALT="photograph of Ivor"/>
						<span>Ivor is a 4 year old Horsfield and has been with us for three years.  He is very active and loves to run round his enclosure and try to climb out.  He is unfortunately quite aggressive, and if left out with the other tortoises will try to bite them.  His favourite passtime seems to be trying to annoy Nessie! He was kept in with Nessie when we first got him, but she can be a bit of a bully, and has been known to give hime a hefty kick.  This resulted in an injury to his eye, so Ivor now lives in his own enclosure.</span>

						<h4>Penn</h4>

						<IMG SRC="images\penn.JPG" ALT="Photograph of Penn"/>
						<span>Penn is an 11 year old Spur Thighed tortoise (Testudo Graeca) and has lived with us for less than a year.  He was previously owned by a family member who had bought two babies (Penn and Teller) several years ago.  Unfortunately Teller passed on over the winter this year and Penn was given to us to adopt.  He is a very mild mannered tortoise who likes having his head rubbed.  He has his own indoor enclosure, but on warm summer days likes to go out and play with Nessie in the garden.  He is also a very greedy tortoise, and likes nothing better than to stuff his face with any plants and vegetables he can get to.  His favourite is dandelions.</span>
