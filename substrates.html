    				<h2>Substrates and Decor</h2>

    				<p>It is important to choose substrates and decor that provide a good environment for your tortoise.  There are many different types of substrate on the market, and lots of options when it comes to furnishing and decorating your tortoises enclosure.  It is always a good idea to research first, as what is good for one type of tortoise may be bad for another.</p>

    				<h3>Substrates</h3>

    				<p>I have used several different types of substrate for my tortoises on a trial and error basis.</p>
    				<p>I first tried reptile carpet as it is usually easy to clean and can be washed, but found that tortoise claws (especially with Horsfields who like to dig) soon tear the carpet, and there looked like there would be a danger of Nessie ingesting some of the fibres.</p>
    				<p>I have used hemp bedding (can be found in most reptile stores/livery supply stores) which is also easy to clean out, extremely absorbent and doesn't smell.  Nessie seems very happy with this type of substrate and doesn't seem to want to eat it or trail it through her water bowl, but both Ivor and Penn have a tendency of paddling and then walking back and forth from substrate to water.  This means they end up filling their water with the highly absorbent hemp leaving them without water.</p>
    				<p>To combat this problem I have replaced their substrate with 'Tortoise Life', a soil based, sandy substance with added calcium.  As it is soil based it does stamp down quite a lot when they walk on it, provides a nice digable substrate for them, and if they eat it should not do any harm. Ivor still insists on washing his feet in the water bowl so it has to be changed more frequently, but Penn seems to have stopped dropping bits in his!</p>

    				<h3>Furnishings and Decor</h3>

    				<p>tortoises like to walk around, and being unable to squeeze through small gaps it is best to keep your tortoise's enclosure as uncluttered as possible.  Having said that, if left with no decoration or furnishing at all they are likely to get bored of plodding the same square box, and a few items of interest for them to climb on will add an extra dimension to their exercise regime.</p>
    				<p>Flattish rocks, cork bark and non-toxic wood make good climbing areas, or a large, flat topped resin snake hide makes a good basking spot.  Tortoises also like to hide under things, so wooden tunnels or hollow logs can also be used (make sure your tortoise can't get stuck!).  Large terracotta plant pots also make good hides, and are easier to clean than wood or bark options.</p>

    				<p>When decorating, if you do not have a cover for your enclosure, please make sure that any rocks or wood placed in the tortoise table does not provide a means of escape for your tortoise!  Place larger items away from the edges, or make sure that the tortoise cannot reach the top of the enclosure.  Despite their looks, tortoises (especially Horsfields) are excellent climbers!  Ivor is already beginning to outgrow his table and is going to need either a bigger table, or some DIY wall heightening very soon.</p>

    				<p>You can also put plants in your tortoise enclosure.  Grasses can provide cover for your tortoise, and for the most part your tortoise won't eat them (depending on the species of tortoise), but please make sure if you are going to put other plants in, that they are none toxic!</p>

    				<p>Artificial plants can also be used, but again, make sure they are designed for reptile use, and that they can't be used as a ladder to enable the tortoise to escape.</p>

    				<p>Similar decorations can be used in outdoor enclosures so that your tortoise can explore and play in the sun.  Tunnels and plant pots can also provide a shaded area for your tortoise so they can get out of the sun if they need to.</p>
