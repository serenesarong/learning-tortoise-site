					<h2>Enclosures</h2>

					<p>A tortoise's environment is very important for their wellbeing and health.  As tortoises in the wild come from a wide variety of habitats it is necessary to provide a home for your tortoise that is as close to their natural environment as possible when considering factors such as temperature, humidity, and even substrates.</p>

						<h3>Tortoise Tables</h3>

						<p>Most tortoises do not do well in glass or wooden vivariums, even with proper lighting and heating, as there is not enough ventilation and it is difficult to maintain temperature gradients and humidity levels.  For this reason I have my tortoises in tortoise tables.  These provide a large area for the tortoise to exercise, a hide area, and enough space above to install heating and lighting to maintain a good basking area temperature and temperature gradient</p>

							<h3>Outdoor areas</h3>

							<p>Even if your tortoise has a large indoor enclosure, they will do better if they have access to an outdoor area where they can get more exercise, natural sunlight and a change of scenery</p>

							<p>Tortoises can be left to roam freely in a garden (provided there are no animals that could cause injuries).  You must make sure that the garden is escape proof.  Remember that tortoises can dig and climb quite well, and if left in a garden will most likely bury themselves under bushes, or dig themselves into flower beds for shelter.</p>

							<p>As my garden is not escape-proof I keep my tortoises in a pen, with an indoor area out of the sun.</p>
